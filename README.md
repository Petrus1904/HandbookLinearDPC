# Handbook Linear Data-driven Predictive Control - Examples
This repository contains MATLAB code examples of implementing different data-driven predictive controllers (DPC) on 2 different systems. 

Requirements:
YALMIP -- you could re-express the problem in a quadprog shape, but YALMIP is used for readability
MATLAB SysID toolbox -- For data acquisition and system identification of the MPC controllers.
Optional OSQP
